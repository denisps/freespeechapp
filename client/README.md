# FreeSpeechApp Client

Web-based client for secure communication using HTTP polling.

## Features

- Clean, modern user interface
- HTTP polling for real-time communication (no WebSockets)
- Cloudflare compatible
- Broadcast and direct messaging
- Connection status indicator
- Message history display
- Responsive design
- Zero external dependencies

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Enter the server URL (e.g., `https://localhost:8443`)
3. Click "Connect"
4. Start sending messages

## How It Works

The client uses HTTP polling instead of WebSockets:

1. **Connect**: POST to `/connect` to get a client ID
2. **Poll**: GET `/poll` every 2 seconds to fetch new messages
3. **Send**: POST to `/send` to send messages
4. **Disconnect**: POST to `/disconnect` when done

This approach is compatible with:
- ✅ Cloudflare free plan
- ✅ Any HTTP proxy/CDN
- ✅ Corporate firewalls
- ✅ Restrictive networks

## Deployment

The client is a static web application consisting of:
- `index.html` - Main HTML file
- `app.js` - JavaScript application logic (polling implementation)
- `style.css` - Styling

Deploy these files to:
- Any web server (nginx, Apache)
- Static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
- CDN (Cloudflare Pages)
- Or open locally in a browser

## Configuration

Edit the default server URL in `index.html`:
```html
<input type="text" id="serverUrl" placeholder="https://your-server.com" value="https://your-server.com">
```

## Polling Interval

The default polling interval is 2 seconds. To change it, edit `app.js`:
```javascript
const POLL_INTERVAL = 2000; // milliseconds
```

## Security Note

When connecting to a server with a self-signed certificate, your browser will show a security warning. You'll need to accept the certificate to proceed. For production use, consider using a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority.
